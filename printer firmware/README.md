READ ME PLEASE:

The contents of this directory are here so you have the source code for your version of the 3D printer.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO INSTALL ANY OF THE CODE IN THIS DIRECTORY FOR YOUR PRINTER TO WORK!!!

The printer firmware is already installed on the printer - installing the firmware here without having the
Ardurino IDE configured properly will cause the LCD display to now work properly and most likely will cause
your printer to not function properly as well.

If you MUST install the software or want to perform tweeks to the configuration files (which WILL void the Warrenty)
and we will know if you do install the firmware be sure to install the contents of the Addon directory contained
within the ardurino source code folder contained in this directory.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!
